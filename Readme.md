JACE RESTURANT <br />


  ## Description
  This is an application for an imaginary restaurant that serves breakfast and drinks in the city. It has both front end and back end functionality and follows all standard full stack dev rules in terms of file structure and best practices. The application has two sides, the user side and the kitchen (staff) side so that the the company can have one platform for full functionality of their business. The user will need to create a profile and sign in to look at the menu and pay for their meals.  We integrated strip to simulate a check out option for user and for the kitchen we created away for the team to see what orders have been placed and the functionality to delete the order once they are done
